# E-Commerce Analytics: Customer Segmentation & High-Value Prediction

This project analyzes ~398k online retail transactions to uncover customer behavior, identify top-selling products, and reveal cross-selling opportunities. Customers were segmented into VIPs, mid-tier, and at-risk groups, while high-value buyers were predicted using a Random Forest model.

Key insights include:
- Top products and UK market drive the most revenue.
- Seasonal dips highlight inventory planning opportunities.
- Product bundles identified with FP-Growth suggest targeted promotions.
- Actionable insights enable personalized marketing campaigns, retention strategies, and sustainable revenue growth.

The notebook demonstrates how data-driven analysis can guide business decisions and marketing strategies effectively.
